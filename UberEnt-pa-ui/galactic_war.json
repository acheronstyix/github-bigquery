Four years into the war, the Xziphid Hegemony invaded the system and killed or enslaved over eighty percent of the population. Team members of the Breslau City Bearcats football club formed an underground resistance against the Xziphid. They fought for over seven years until the system was liberated by Progenitor forces led by Commander Rohl."

    "With the capability of supporting almost any kind of organic life form, the General Assembly voted to turn Dayuan into the official \"zoo system\" of the Progenitor Coalition. Nearly every kind of species found scattered throughout Progenitor Coalition space could be viewed in the Dayuan system. With top shelf resorts, Dayuan was a popular vacation destination for Progenitors. All life in the system was exterminated by Machine Liberation Army forces during the Pro-Com War.": {

Like Hatuamoto before it, the MLA had no answer against the Progenitor flotilla and the system was quickly liberated.": {

    "Zarco was a minimum security system set aside by the Progenitor Coalition for non-violent criminals. Prisoners in the system were permitted all the comforts of high tech living with one caveat: anyone caught attempting to leave the prison before their sentence was up would be immediately vaporized. One of its more famous inmates was promoter J.L. Barnaby; sentenced to five years in Zarco after a disastrous PR stunt in Tsunenaga. After five years, Barnaby was de facto ruler of his own small fiefdom in the prison. Coalition authorities had to forcefully remove him when he refused to leave, even after his sentence was up.": {

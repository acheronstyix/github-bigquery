# Engines can analyze files and report issues on them, but you can separately
# decide which files will receive ratings based on those issues. This is
# specified by path patterns under the ratings key.

# For more details see here:
# http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/289-configuring-your-repository-via-codeclimate-yml#platform

# ratings:
#   paths:
#   - app/**
#   - lib/**
#   - "**.rb"
#   - "**.go"

# You can globally exclude files from being analyzed by any engine using the
# exclude_paths key.

exclude_paths:
  - spec/**/*
  - vendor/**/*

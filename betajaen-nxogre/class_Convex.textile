p(d). A convex is a convex point cloud (with optional triangles) that is used from a Mesh file.

Convex shapes can be used in Actors, KinematicActors, StaticGeometries and Volumes for
collisions and testing against them.


h3(s). See

p(s). Shape

h2(fn destructor). <a name='Convex'></a>Convex

p(d). As with all Shapes, deleting the Convex should be left to the class that is responsible for it.


p(n). **Note** -- Deleting the Convex whilst it is attached to a RigidBody will probably cause a nasty crash.


h2(fn function). <a name='getMesh'></a>getMesh

p(d). Get the mesh


p(n). **Note** -- MeshManager owns this pointer. Do not delete it.


h3. Return

p(r). **Mesh** * -- The mesh shared by the Convex.


h2(fn function). <a name='getShapeFunctionType'></a>getShapeFunctionType

p(d). Get the shape type based upon the Classes::ShapeFunctionType enum.


h3. Return

p(r). **ShapeFunctionType** -- This type of shape as a ShapeFunctionType enum.
